# About Coding Aztecs:
### _Anyone Can Code_ 
I believe that anyone can learn to code. As coding becomes more prevalent throughout
the world, it will soon become as common to learn as subjects like Math, Physics, Chemistry etc.
Seeing how important it can be to start coding as early as possible motivated me to
inspire youth at Mendota to learn to code.

### _Inspire_
My goal is to inspire youth to follow their dreams. Whether
that be programming or not, I hope students can use me as a role model and 
realize that they can make their dreams come true. As historically underrepresented minorities from a small rural farming town, the
odds are stacked against us. Many of our parents did not attend high school, and we
are the first generation of our families to be attending college. It will not be easy but,
I know that with proper guidance and support, Mendota students can use their
diligence and hardworking-spirit to succeed. 

### _About Me_
My name is Jose Ochoa, a former student of Mendota High School (Class of 2021).
At the time of writing this, I am going into my Sophomore year of college at UC
Berkeley. My first year was filled with struggles and doubts rampant in my head.
However, I never gave up, and now I know that nothing will stop me from achieving
my goals. I am passionate about giving back to the community and recycling my success. 
I want all Mendota students to be able to make their dreams come true, to 
break the cycle of social mobility, and to prove to the world that Hispanics are not just hard workers
in fields of labor.
