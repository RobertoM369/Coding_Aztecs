# Helpful resources for learning code

### Pytutor:
[Pytutor](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) is a resource that is helpful in visualizing and stepping through your python code.

### Code CS 61A:
[CS 61A Code](https://code.cs61a.org/) is a useful free online interpreter for python code. There are many other interpreters
available online but, I enjoy using this one the most. 

### Coding Bat:
[Coding Bat](https://codingbat.com/python) is a website that is useful for coding practice. 
Here you can solve problems of different difficulties.

### Leet Code:
Similar to Coding Bat, [Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/) has a lot of coding questions but are more geared towards
preparing you for interview questions. Leet code is used by many in the CS community, especially aspiring software-engineers.

### Scrimba:
[Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/allcourses?price=free) is an online learning-platform that offers a multitude of CS classes. Here you can find many classes
for free that will teach you programming languages, important concepts and more.

### CS 61A:
[CS 61A](https://cs61a.org/) is an introductory coding class at UC Berkeley. The website has a lot of useful resources
and assignments that students can take a look at.

### Khan Academy:
[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/search?referer=%2Fprofile%2Fme%2Fcourses&page_search_query=CS) offers some courses in CS as well.
I am sure you are aware of Khan Academy, it is a great platform for learning all subjects, not just CS. 

### More
There are plenty of other resources available to learn Coding online, even YouTube! In this day and age you can learn pretty much anything
online as long as you put in the hours it takes to learn and practice. Be cautious and try to stay away from the "Learn Python in 1 hour!"
type of videos, as they may be useful for conceptual overview but, it is impossible to learn a programming language in that short amount of time.
I understand it can be pretty stressful and difficult navigating all these resources
at times, and if you ever need any help feel free to reach out to me.
